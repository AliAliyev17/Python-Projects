# Python-Projects

Instagram Image Downloader project is program built in python 3.7. User interface is created using Tkinter module. To initiate the program open main.py. 

Before doing that make sure to check Downloader.py to add directory that you want to download images/videos into. Which part of code you should change is shown using comments. 

Thank you for being interested in my project.
